> Rocketseat challenge

Project made for the Countdown challenge from Rocketseat. I went further and made a backend to fetch the API start time data for calculating the remaining time.

The frontend was made using HTML, CSS, Typescript, ReactJS and Vite. Deployed via Github Pages.

The backend was made using NodeJS, Express, Cors, Prisma and PostgreSQL. Deployed via Heroku.
